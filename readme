psycopg2 - is a postreSQL adapter used to connect python to a postres database

Terms of importance
*internet - interconnection of computers / global network of connected devices.
*www - worldwide web --> a service that connects users to the internet via the browser.
*hosting - uploading application files to a server so that it can be visible to others online


1.build your application
2.send your files to a server
3.ip address is assigned to the application
 
**ip address -> a number that is used to uniquely identify a device on a network e.g 170.100.03.80 **ipv4**
(various categories depending on the network)

domain name - a user friendly name attached to an ip address to enable users access applications e.g www.google.com / www.netflix.com


developer uploads app files to a server
that server has an ip address
to access the app hosted on the server, we use the server ip address -> 170.100.02.80

**DNS - domain name system - the internets phone-book used to translate domain names into ip addresses.

127.0.0.1 -> ip address of your device
localhost -> domain name

host -> local host (your domain name)
port -> where exactly in my device id the database located
user & password - authentication

**PSYCOPG2**
A PostgreSQL adapter (driver) used to connect Python to a Postres database

C create --> insert
R Read - select
U Update - 
D Delete

con.commit() - updates the database with the new state
---> add 5 products

**TASK*
1.Brush up on:
--> sql queries, joins, where etc
--> python functions, data types, type conversion, loops, if statements, lists and tuples

2.research on another method apart from f-string that would be used to add products dynamically
----<hint: use %5>

3.create two functions to:
 -> insert 2 sales using psycopg2 --> insert sales()
 -> view my sales using psycopg2 --> get_sales
