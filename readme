psycopg2 - is a postreSQL adapter used to connect python to a postres database

Terms of importance
*internet - interconnection of computers / global network of connected devices.
*www - worldwide web --> a service that connects users to the internet via the browser.
*hosting - uploading application files to a server so that it can be visible to others online


1.build your application
2.send your files to a server
3.ip address is assigned to the application
 
**ip address -> a number that is used to uniquely identify a device on a network e.g 170.100.03.80 **ipv4**
(various categories depending on the network)

domain name - a user friendly name attached to an ip address to enable users access applications e.g www.google.com / www.netflix.com


developer uploads app files to a server
that server has an ip address
to access the app hosted on the server, we use the server ip address -> 170.100.02.80

**DNS - domain name system - the internets phone-book used to translate domain names into ip addresses.

127.0.0.1 -> ip address of your device
localhost -> domain name

host -> local host (your domain name)
port -> where exactly in my device id the database located
user & password - authentication

**PSYCOPG2**
A PostgreSQL adapter (driver) used to connect Python to a Postres database

C create --> insert
R Read - select
U Update - 
D Delete

con.commit() - updates the database with the new state
---> add 5 products

**TASK*
1.Brush up on:
--> sql queries, joins, where etc
--> python functions, data types, type conversion, loops, if statements, lists and tuples

2.research on another method apart from f-string that would be used to add products dynamically
----<hint: use %s>

3.create two functions to:
 -> insert 2 sales using psycopg2 --> insert sales()
 -> view my sales using psycopg2 --> get_sales

               OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
--> We have the following broad categories of classifying data types.
1.Inbuilt data types - data types that come with the programming language
     e.g. Python --> int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, set, dict

2.User defined data types - are data types created by the programmer
 (enabled by the use of classes and objects e.g Person, Student, Car)


OOP -->A programming paradigm that builds programs around classes and objects.
 
 **Classes**
 --> a blueprint or a template for creating objects 
 **Objects**
 --> an instance of a class

 **a class is defined by:
     1.attributes - variables holding data in a class.
                       - answer the question what does a class have.
          e.g class Person --> name, age, height,weight,marital_status, address
              class Car --> engine, year_of_make, model, colour
          
     2.behaviour -defined by methods
          -->Behaviour answers the question: what can a person do?
          class Car - start, move, stop

 **Methods**
--> Functions inside classes

 **Constructor** - a special method used to initialize objects.
 --<it is automatically called when an object is created>
 **Self**
 -references the object itself.
