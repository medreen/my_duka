psycopg2 - is a postreSQL adapter used to connect python to a postres database

Terms of importance
*internet - interconnection of computers / global network of connected devices.
*www - worldwide web --> a service that connects users to the internet via the browser.
\*hosting - uploading application files to a server so that it can be visible to others online

1.build your application
2.send your files to a server
3.ip address is assigned to the application

**ip address -> a number that is used to uniquely identify a device on a network e.g 170.100.03.80 **ipv4\*\*
(various categories depending on the network)

domain name - a user friendly name attached to an ip address to enable users access applications e.g www.google.com / www.netflix.com

developer uploads app files to a server
that server has an ip address
to access the app hosted on the server, we use the server ip address -> 170.100.02.80

\*\*DNS - domain name system - the internets phone-book used to translate domain names into ip addresses.

127.0.0.1 -> ip address of your device
localhost -> domain name

host -> local host (your domain name)
port -> where exactly in my device id the database located
user & password - authentication

**PSYCOPG2**
A PostgreSQL adapter (driver) used to connect Python to a Postres database

C create --> insert
R Read - select
U Update -
D Delete

con.commit() - updates the database with the new state
---> add 5 products

\*_TASK_
1.Brush up on:
--> sql queries, joins, where etc
--> python functions, data types, type conversion, loops, if statements, lists and tuples

2.research on another method apart from f-string that would be used to add products dynamically
----<hint: use %s>

3.create two functions to:
-> insert 2 sales using psycopg2 --> insert sales()
-> view my sales using psycopg2 --> get_sales

               OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

--> We have the following broad categories of classifying data types.
1.Inbuilt data types - data types that come with the programming language
e.g. Python --> int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, set, dict

2.User defined data types - are data types created by the programmer
(enabled by the use of classes and objects e.g Person, Student, Car)

_OOP_ -->A programming paradigm that builds programs around classes and objects.

**Classes**
--> a blueprint or a template for creating objects

**Objects**
--> an instance of a class

\*\*a class is defined by:
1.attributes - variables holding data in a class. - answer the question what does a class have.
e.g class Person --> name, age, height,weight,marital_status, address
class Car --> engine, year_of_make, model, colour

     2.behaviour -defined by methods
          -->Behaviour answers the question: what can a person do?
          class Car - start, move, stop

**Methods**
--> Functions inside classes

**Constructor** - a special method used to initialize objects.
--<it is automatically called when an object is created>
Python uses **init**(self,parameters)

**Self**
-references the object itself.

**Parameters**
---> attributes of a class.

--INHERITANCE--
A concept where one class acquires / inherits properties from another class
--> allows you to reuse code instead of rewriting everything from scratch.

_Parent class_ --> class from which properties are inherited(base class)

_Child class_ --> inheriting properties from another class(derived class)

//Why use inheritance//
1.Avoids duplicated code
2.Adds new features to an existing class
3.Allows behaviour modification - method overriding

Types of Inheritance
1.Single inheritance
---> a child class inherits from one single parent class
2.Multiple inheritance
---> a child class inherits from more than one parent class.
3.Multilevel inheritance
---> a child class inherits from a parent and the parent inherits from another parent
4.Hierrachial inheritance
---> multiple children inherit from one parent

Method over-riding
--> This is where a child class provides its own implementation of a method that already exists in the parent class.
--> the child method replaces the parent's

To avoid method overriding we use .super _method name_
whenever we initialize an attribute the childs breaks off from the parent

**str** is used to avoid having a memory location printed when we asign objects to the class
such that when used it returns the exact object and not the memory location.

\*_dunder methods_

\_\_name --> used to prevent name mungling

**FLASK**
A python framework used to build web applications.

Framework vs Library
-->

A mechanism to map or connect urls to python functions.
Its a system for resource navigation
---> connects a url to a function in the flask app.

_URL_ -> uniform resource locator
(full address used to access resources on the web)

**parts of a url**
1.Protocol - tells the browser how to communicate
(http _data is sent as raw text_ & https --s -> secure--- _data is encripted_ we use an ssl or a tls)
2.Domain name - name of the website
3.port (optional)- where exactly to find the service
4.path - the specific page or resource
5.fragments
6.query parameter

In Flask, routing is executed using a decorator function ---> @app.route() \*_Decorator function_
a function that allows you to modify or

The @app.route() decorator function can take some parameters:
-Rule / Path
-Methods

\*\*Index route - / --> default home / landing route

TASK
Import get_sales to flask and display them in your browser
Adjust your project structure to have the structure below

My-Duka -
-> database.py
-> main.py
-> folder ---> static
-> folder ---> templates
-index.html
-products.html
-sales.html
-dashboard.html
-log-in.html
-register.html

instead of returning simple text we now
to return html pages with flask we use an inbuilt function imported from Flask called render_template()
render_template("nameoffile") \*_the file has to be inside the template folder_

Template inheritance - reducing redudancy in creatin html pages by creating one common html file that defined the structure of every single html file.
---< this file will contain all common componenrs accross all pages >
-Every html file will now inherit the common components from it
-Template inheritance in Flask uses Jinja syntax

{% extends 'base.html' %} --> inherit all common components

Jinja 2 syntax
Jinja is a syntax inbuilt with flask to render Python data

For variables (key features)
--> {{ }} syntax
-->Control structures {% %} \*_Key features of control structures_

POSTING DATA
Workflow - sending resources / requests to a server from a client
e.g Posting a picture on ig

1.Provide a user with a form to insert data
2.User fills the form and submits it --> submitted to a Flask route
--> data coming from the form to the server is sent in key-value pairs

    *name* - attribute used to identify a form element when sending to a server

    Form Checklist
    -< everything a form requires in order to submit a form to Flask>

    action attribute - defines the route where the forms data is to be submitted
    method --->
        *HTTP Methods*
        1. GET - fetching data from a server
        2. POST - sending data / request to a server (inserting products, making sales)
        3. PUT - updating an exsisting resource (changing password, changing product name)
        4. DELETE - getting rid of a resource (deleting a product)

    name
    input type
    button --> submit

3.Flask extracts from data and processses it
flask uses a request object to extract data fromn the form using the key
(comes from the name attribute)
---> request.form - method used to access and extract form data using keys
---> request.method - method used to extract the method using the form

     *import request from flask*

4.Store / insert this data using functions
  --store the data in a tuple
  --import the function to insert and use it
  --the user is redirected

5.A user is redirected
--use redirect function imported from flask
--redirect also takes another function 
in the method ---> redirect(url_for(''))

name attribute is used to identify form elements when sending data to a server

Attempt inserting at  least one sale using a form from a modal

fetchall() / fetchmany -> returns list of tuples
fetchone -> returns a tuple (because only value is returned)

task 
---> write a function to insert stock, create stock route and stock page that 
can post stock from a form
--> write a query to fetch the following data:
 -> sales_per_product
 -> sales_per_day
 -> profit_per_day
 -> profit_per_product

--> get 2 bootsrap forms for the following pages and have the listed form inputs
a. Login --> email
             password
             button - type submit
b. Register 
     -> full_name
     -> email
     -> phone_number
     -> password
     -> button (type submit)

-> continue building and styling

__Flash messages have two parts__
--> Message - the actual text feedback
--> Category - broader class of messages grouped by type
